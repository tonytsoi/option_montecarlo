# Option Pricing with Monte Carlo Method â€“The Martingales Theory

The Black Scholes option pricing model is typically used to price vanilla European options. However, when it comes to options with more complex structure, for example, for option payoffs that depend on how the underlying price evolves over the time when the option contract was active, numerical techniques are usually required for pricing these types of exotic options. 

In <a href=https://medium.com/@tsoiyingkit/option-pricing-with-monte-carlo-method-the-martingales-theory-61e263bef024>this article</a>, I provide a brief overview of the underlying theory, and set out how the Monte Carlo method can be used to price options that are path dependent, and to approximate the option delta, as well as the derivation showing the equivalence between the Monte Carlo method and Black Scholes model.
